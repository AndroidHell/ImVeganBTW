# ImVeganBTW

A simple app that will translate common dietary phrases to a selected language.

Veganism was in mind but this app can be used for vegetarians and also has a phrase for gluten sensitivity.

This is a rough proof of concept.

Things that don't work correctly:
- The Title translates to the phone's locale instead of the in-app selected language
- The text overflows if it is too long
-- will make it scroll
-- or use smaller phrases like "no meat" and "no dairy"
- the Language tab does not unhighlight when Save it clicked and the app goes back to home
